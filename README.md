# My [personal website](https://www.aleodsconer.com) made using:
- Rust+Axum+ructe for the backend.
Rust is my language of choice for most projects.
Axum is a simple yet effective web server library.
Ructe is a templating library but I intend to change it in the future with my own templating library.

- htmx+elm+sass for the frontend.
Htmx allow for easy web reloading and querying the server.

- Nix+docker for the tooling + deployment.
I'm using nix for the dev environement with the docker nix integration for the deployment.
